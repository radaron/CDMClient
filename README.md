# CDMClient
**CDM - Centralized Download Manager Client**
CDMClient is the client application for the [CDM Server](https://github.com/radaron/CDMServer/tree/master).

This client communicates with the CDM Server to periodically send the download status from Transmission/QBittorrent and check for new torrent files to download. If new torrents are available, they are downloaded and added to Transmission/QBittorrent client.

## Installation

### Install or Upgrade the Package
Run the following command to install or upgrade CDMClient:
```shell
python3 -m pip install --upgrade CDMClient --user
```

### Create a Systemd Service
To set up CDMClient as a systemd service, execute the following commands:

1. Create the service file:
   ```shell
   echo "[Unit]
   Description=cdm-client service
   After=multi-user.target
   Conflicts=getty@tty1.service

   [Service]
   User=${USER}
   Type=simple
   Environment=LC_ALL=C.UTF-8
   Environment=LANG=C.UTF-8
   ExecStart=${HOME}/.local/bin/cdm-client
   Restart=on-failure
   RestartSec=3

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target" | sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/cdm-client.service
   ```

2. Reload systemd and enable the service:
   ```shell
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl enable cdm-client.service
   sudo systemctl start cdm-client.service
   ```

### Add automatic update (optional)
To keep CDMClient updated automatically, you can add a cron job. Run:
```shell
crontab -e
```
Then add the following line to the crontab file:
```shell
0 3 * * * /usr/bin/python3 -m pip install --upgrade CDMClient --user && systemctl restart cdm-client.service
```

## Configuration
The configuration file is located at:
```~/.config/cdm_client/config.ini```

This file is automatically generated when the service starts. Below is an example configuration:

```ini
[connection]
server_host = "https://cdmserver.com"
api_key = "1409d6ed79280aadcbe20f8f21981e89"
client_host =
client_port =
client_username =
client_password =
client_type= transmission # possible values: transmission or qbitorrent
```

### Configuration Details:
- **`server_host`**: The full URL of the CDM Server (e.g., `https://cdmserver.com`).
- **`api_key`**: The API key generated when adding a new device on the CDM Server's devices page. Refer to the [Devices Page Documentation](https://github.com/radaron/CDMServer/blob/master/doc/USAGE.md#devices-page).
- **`client_username`** and **`client_password`**: Required authentication for the selected torrent client.
- **`client_type`**: Specify either `transmission` or `qbitorrent`, depending on the torrent client you are using.
- **`client_host`** and **`client_port`**: Optional. If not specified, defaults to `localhost` and the default port for the selected client type.
